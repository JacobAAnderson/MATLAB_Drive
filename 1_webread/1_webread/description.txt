These are the example files shown in the "Reading Web Pages, Part 1: 
Using webread" video on the "Stuart's MATLAB Videos" blog.

- path2enlightenment.m is the initial script that follows Wikipedia pages,
  displaying the name of each page as it goes.

- philosophydegrees.m is the modified script developed in the video that 
  keeps a record of the pages visited and makes a table of the pages and 
  the corresponding number of steps to the "Philosophy" page.

- findfirstlink.m is the function that parses the html of the Wikipedia
  page and determines the name of the first page linked. (Following the 
  "rules of the game", it actually finds the first link in the main text
  that isn't in italics or inside parentheses.)
