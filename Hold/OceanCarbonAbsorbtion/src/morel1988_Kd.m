%function Kd = morel1988_Kd(chl,wave);
%
function [Kd,wv] = morel1988_Kd(chl);
% form is from Morel 1988, but updated by Morel & Maritorena (2001)
% output is spectral diffuse attenuation (Kd).....i.e., subtract water if you want 
% particulate backscatter (bbp).  Kw is a combination of bw from S&B(1981) and aw
% from Pope and Fry (1997).
